## Overview
This Python program is designed to predict click-through rates (CTR) using machine learning techniques. It processes data, trains a model, and evaluates its performance to provide accurate CTR predictions.

### Process
Data Processing: Cleans and preprocesses the input data.
Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features for model training.
Model Training: Uses various machine learning algorithms to train the model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
Prediction: Provides CTR predictions for new data.
